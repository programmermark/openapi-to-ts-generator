 *
 * See {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#appendix-e-percent-encoding-and-form-media-types Appendix E} for a detailed examination of percent-encoding concerns, including interactions with the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` query string format.
 *
 * **Parameter Locations**
 *
 * There are four possible parameter locations specified by the `in` field:
 *
 * - path - Used together with {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#path-templating Path Templating}, where the parameter value is actually part of the operation's URL. This does not include the host or base path of the API. For example, in `/items/{itemId}`, the path parameter is `itemId`.
 * - query - Parameters that are appended to the URL. For example, in `/items?id=###`, the query parameter is `id`.
 * - header - Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that {@link https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2 RFC7230} states header names are case insensitive.
 * - cookie - Used to pass a specific cookie value to the API.
 *
 * **Fixed Fields**
 *
 * The rules for serialization of the parameter are specified in one of two ways. Parameter Objects MUST include either a `content` field or a `schema` field, but not both. See {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#appendix-b-data-type-conversion Appendix B} for a discussion of converting values of various types to string representations.
 *
 * This object MAY be extended with {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#specification-extensions Specification Extensions}.
 *
 * Note that while `"Cookie"` as a `name` is not forbidden if `in` is `"header"`, the effect of defining a cookie parameter that way is undefined; use `in: "cookie"` instead.
 *
 * **Fixed Fields for use with schema**
 *
 * For simpler scenarios, a {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#parameter-schema `schema`} and {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#parameter-style `style`} can describe the structure and syntax of the parameter. When `example` or `examples` are provided in conjunction with the `schema` field, the example SHOULD match the specified schema and follow the prescribed serialization strategy for the parameter. The `example` and `examples` fields are mutually exclusive, and if either is present it SHALL _override_ any `example` in the schema.
 *
 * Serializing with `schema` is NOT RECOMMENDED for `in: "cookie"` parameters, `in: "header"` parameters that use HTTP header parameters (name=value pairs following a `;`) in their values, or `in: "header"` parameters where values might have non-URL-safe characters; see {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#appendix-d-serializing-headers-and-cookies Appendix D} for details.
 *
 * See also {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#appendix-c-using-rfc6570-based-serialization Appendix C: Using RFC6570-Based Serialization} for additional guidance.
 *
 * **Fixed Fields for use with `content`**
 *
 * For more complex scenarios, the {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#parameter-content `content`} field can define the media type and schema of the parameter, as well as give examples of its use. Using `content` with a `text/plain` media type is RECOMMENDED for `in: "header"` and `in: "cookie"` parameters where the `schema` strategy is not appropriate.
 *
 * **Style Values**
 *
 * In order to support common ways of serializing simple parameters, a set of `style` values are defined.
 *
 * See {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#appendix-e-percent-encoding-and-form-media-types Appendix E} for a discussion of percent-encoding, including when delimiters need to be percent-encoded and options for handling collisions with percent-encoded data.

 * - maxItems
 * - minItems
 * - uniqueItems
 * - maxProperties
 * - minProperties
 * - required
 * - enum
 *
 * The following keywords are taken from the JSON Schema definition but their definitions were adjusted to the OpenAPI Specification.
 *
 * - type - Value MUST be a string. Multiple types via an array are not supported.
 * - allOf - Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#schema-object Schema Object} and not a standard JSON Schema.
 * - oneOf - Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#schema-object Schema Object} and not a standard JSON Schema.
 * - anyOf - Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#schema-object Schema Object} and not a standard JSON Schema.
 * - not - Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#schema-object Schema Object} and not a standard JSON Schema.
 * - items - Value MUST be an object and not an array. Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.4.md#schema-object Schema Object} and not a standard JSON Schema. `items` MUST be present if `type` is `"array"`.

 * - default - The default value represents what would be assumed by the consumer of the input as the value of the schema if one is not provided. Unlike JSON Schema, the value MUST conform to the defined `type` for the Schema Object defined at the same level.
